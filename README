Built as a student project at Yale University in 2010, HORROR: A Visual Index is a ruby on rails website that catagorizes and sorts user submitted images from horror films from around the world since the genre evolved.

By searching the Index, cinematic, cultural and stylistic trends in the art form become apparent.

Enjoy!
